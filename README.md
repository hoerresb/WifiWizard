# WifiWizard

Version 0.2.10

`getCurrentBSSID` now available on IOS.

~~Fixed callback issue with `connectNetwork`.~~

Updated permissions for Android Marshmallow.

Version 0.2.9

This Phonegap plugin enables WiFi management from within Phonegap applications.

iOS has limited functionality, as Apple's WifiManager equivalent is only available as a private API. Any app that used these features would not be allowed on the app store. The only function availabe for iOS is `getCurrentSSID`.

### Installation

#### Master

Run `phonegap plugin install https://github.com/parsonsmatt/WifiWizard.git`. Please note that the plugin is in active development, and this will pull the most recent commits.

#### Releases

Run `cordova plugin add wifiwizard`. This will get the latest release of the plugin.

### Usage from within Cordova/Phonegap:

#### `WifiWizard.formatWifiConfig(SSID, password, algorithm);` 

Formats the wifi configuration information into a JSON for use with the addNetwork function. Currently, only WPA is supported for the `algorithm` value.

#### `WifiWizard.formatWPAConfig(SSID, password);` 

Is a helper method. It returns an object which can be used to add a WPA wifi network.

#### `WifiWizard.addNetwork(wifi, win, fail);` 

Adds the network to the list of available networks that the user can log into. `wifi` needs to be an object as formatted by formatWifiConfig. `win` and `fail` are callback functions to be executed based on the result of the call.

#### `WifiWizard.removeNetwork(SSID, win, fail);` 

Removes the network with the given SSID. As above, `win` and `fail` are callback functions.

#### `WifiWizard.connectNetwork(SSID, win, fail);` 

Connects the phone to the given Wifi network. Returns the value of the Supplicant State.

#### `WifiWizard.disconnectNetwork(SSID, win, fail);` 

Disconnects the phone to the given Wifi network.

#### `WifiWizard.listNetworks(listHandler, fail);` 

Retrieves a list of the configured networks as an array of strings and passes them to the function listHandler.

#### `WifiWizard.startScan(success, fail);` 

Start WiFi scanning. `success` is a function that is called when the scan is started. 

#### `WifiWizard.getScanResults([options], listHandler, fail);` 

Retrieves a list of the available networks as an array of objects and passes them to the function listHandler. The format of the array is:

    networks = [
        {   "level": signal_level, // raw RSSI value
            "SSID": ssid, // SSID as string, with escaped double quotes: "\"ssid name\""
            "BSSID": bssid // MAC address of WiFi router as string
            "frequency": frequency of the access point channel in MHz
            "capabilities": capabilities // Describes the authentication, key management, and encryption schemes supported by the access point.
        }
    ]

An options object may be passed. Currently, the only supported option is `numLevels`, and it has the following behavior: 

- if `(n == true || n < 2)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will return data as before, split in 5 levels;
- if `(n > 1)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will calculate the signal level, split in n levels;
- if `(n == false)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will use the raw signal level;

#### `WifiWizard.getCurrentSSID(ssidHandler, fail);` 

Retrieves the current SSID and passes it to ssidHandler.

#### `WifiWizard.isWifiEnabled(win, fail);` 

Retrieves the current wifi status and passes `true` or `false` to the handler.

#### `WifiWizard.setWifiEnabled(enabled, win, fail);` 

Set wifi status. `enabled` is a Boolean type, so to disable the Wifi, you'd execute `WifiWizard.setWifiEnabled(false, win, fail);`

### Changelog:

#### v0.2.9

`isWifiEnabled` bug fixed. `level` in `getScanResults` object now refers to raw RSSI value. The function now accepts an options object, and by specifiying `{ numLevels: value }` you can get the old behavior.

#### v0.2.8

`getScanResults` now returns the BSSID along with the SSID and strength of the network.

#### v0.2.7

- Clobber WifiWizard.js automatically via Cordova plugin architecture

#### v0.2.6 

- Added `isWifiEnabled`, `setWifiEnabled`

#### v0.2.5 

- Fixes `getConnectedSSID` error handlers

#### v0.2.4 

- Added `getConnectedSSID` method

#### v0.2.3 

- Added `disconnect` that does disconnection on current WiFi

#### v0.2.2 

- Added `startScan` and `getScanResults`

#### v0.2.1 

- Fixed reference problem in `formatWPAConfig`

#### v0.2.0 

- Changed format of wifiConfiguration object to allow more extensibility.

#### v0.1.1 

- `addNetwork` will now update the network if the SSID already exists.

#### v0.1.0 

- All functions now work!

#### v0.0.3 

- Fixed errors in native implementation. Currently, Add and Remove networks aren't working, but others are working as expected.

#### v0.0.2 

- Changed plugin.xml and WifiWizard.js to attach WifiWizard directly to the HTML.

#### v0.0.1 

- Initial commit
